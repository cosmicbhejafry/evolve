\vknote{Move this para to conclusions:
In the context of evolvability, strong negative results
are known for distribution-independent evolvability of boolean functions, \eg
even the class of conjunctions is not evolvable. However, it is interesting to
study whether under restricted classes of distributions, evolution is possible
for simple, restricted concept classes. Currently, even under (biased) product
distributions, no evolutionary mechanism is known for the class of disjunctions,
except via Feldman's general reduction from CSQ algorithms. The class of
smooth distributions may be a natural starting place for studying
evolvability of simple concept classes.  }
