We define a mutator that effectively minimizes $\lerr_D(w, w^*)$ in a greedy
fashion with respect to $\sparseset(w)$.
Assume that $w$ is initialized so that $\sparseset(w) = \emptyset$.
For $w \in R$, define the mutated representation $w^\prime$, output by the mutator as:
\begin{enumerate}
\item With probability $1/2$ do nothing, set $w^\prime = w$.
\item (Scaling) With probability $1/4 - \delta/2$, choose $\gamma \in [-1, 1]$ uniformly at random and
let $w^\prime = \alpha w$. 
\item (Adjusting) With probability $1/4 - \delta/2$, do the following. Let $S_w = \{ i~|~ w_i \neq 0
\}$. Pick $i \in S_w$ uniformly at random. Let $w^\prime$ denote the
mutated representation, where $w^\prime_j = w_j$ for $j \neq i$, $w^\prime_i \in
[-B, B]$ uniformly at random. 
\item (Adding) With the remaining probability $\delta$, do the following.
If $|S_w| < K$, choose $i \in [n] \setminus S_w$ uniformly at random. Let
$w^\prime$ be the mutated representation, where $w_j^\prime = w_j$ for $j \neq
i$, $w^\prime_i$ is chosen uniformly in $[-B, B]$. 
Otherwise, if $|S_w| = K$, do nothing, set $w^\prime = w$.
\end{enumerate}
