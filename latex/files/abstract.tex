In a seminal paper, Valiant (2006) introduced a computational model for
biological evolution, to address the question of complexity of functions that
may be evolved through Darwinian mechanisms. The goal is to evolve a
representation that computes a function that is \emph{close} to some \emph{ideal
function} under the target distribution. Thus, the question of what classes of
functions is evolvable may be studied through the framework of computational
learning theory.

Feldman (2008) showed that the class of functions evolvable in Valiant's model
were exactly captured by a restriction of Kearns' statistical query learning
framework. P. Valiant considers the evolvability of \emph{real-valued}
functions. 

We consider the notion of \emph{natural}}
